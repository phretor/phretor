### Welcome! 🏡

This is my humble GitHub Home 💻 where can find the [repos I'm most active on](https://github.com/phretor?tab=repositories).

I've been active in the cybersecurity field for about 20 years because
it **challenges me** to solve new exciting problems every day.

I reviewed and tested the security design of hardware, firmware, and
virtualization layers of flagship AI server platforms based on NVidia,
Qualcomm, and Amazon silicon, and multi-rack edge computing
infrastructures, supporting millions of customers worldwide.

I worked in cybersecurity **engineering, research, and development** throughout the
stack: Intel/AMD/ARM server platforms, peripheral and embedded firmware,
web applications, network protocols and devices, embedded protocols and
systems for industrial applications, radio frequency control systems,
ABB and Kuka industrial robots, cars and mobile devices (Android).

I built cloud-native firmware-signing pipelines to enable scalable
secure-boot infrastructures, I built firmware-analysis and
malware-scanning pipelines, threat-intel systems, mobile **ransomware**
detection tools, **fraud**-detection systems, malware **behavior**
mining algorithms, large-scale **internet measurements** studies, and
**anomaly** detection tools.

I coach speakers who want to turn complex cybersecurity topics into clear, engaging, and memorable talks.
