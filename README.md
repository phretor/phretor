### Welcome! 🏡

This is my humble GitHub Home 💻 where can find the [repos I'm most active on](https://github.com/phretor?tab=repositories).

I’m Federico Maggi, and my mission is to bridge complex security challenges with practical business strategy.

I'm a cybersecurity engineer, researcher, and advisor leading security for
the latest hyperscale AI & infrastructure technology and platforms. I have
hands-on experience in offensive and defensive security research on embedded
systems, radio-frequency control systems, industrial robots, cars, and devices.

I help transform complex security engineering & research challenges into actionable
business insights and guide the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.

---

I reviewed and tested the security design of hardware, firmware, and
virtualization layers of flagship AI server platforms based on NVidia,
Qualcomm, and Amazon silicon, and multi-rack edge computing
infrastructures, supporting millions of customers worldwide.

I worked in cybersecurity **engineering, research, and development** throughout the
stack: Intel/AMD/ARM server platforms, peripheral and embedded firmware,
web applications, network protocols and devices, embedded protocols and
systems for industrial applications, radio frequency control systems,
ABB and Kuka industrial robots, cars and mobile devices (Android).

I built cloud-native firmware-signing pipelines to enable scalable
secure-boot infrastructures, I built firmware-analysis and
malware-scanning pipelines, threat-intel systems, mobile **ransomware**
detection tools, **fraud**-detection systems, malware **behavior**
mining algorithms, large-scale **internet measurements** studies, and
**anomaly** detection tools.

I coach speakers who want to turn complex cybersecurity topics into clear,
engaging, and memorable talks.
