### Welcome! 🏡

This is my humble home at GitHub 💻 and here you can find the [repos I'm most active on](https://github.com/phretor?tab=repositories).

I enjoy working on various cyber-security topics. I’ve done offensive and defensive research on web applications, network protocols and devices, embedded systems, radio-frequency control systems, industrial robots, cars, and mobile devices.

I work with Trend Micro Research in a global team that focuses on technology and cyber-crime research. After more than 10 years, I concluded that I’m still around in the infosec area because it gives me so many opportunities to solve new exciting problems every day.
