### Welcome! 🏡

This is my humble home at GitHub 💻 and here you can find the [repos I'm most active on](https://github.com/phretor?tab=repositories).

I enjoy working on various cyber-security topics. I’ve done offensive and defensive research on 🌎 [web](https://maggi.cc/publication/nikiforakis_strangerdanger_2014/) [applications](https://maggi.cc/publication/unruh_joernphp_2017/), 🔗 [network protocols](https://maggi.cc/publication/maggi_mqttwp_tr_2018/) and devices, embedded systems, 📡 [radio-frequency](https://maggi.cc/publication/maggi_industrialradios_2019/) control systems, 🤖 [industrial robots](https://robosec.org), 🚗 [cars](https://maggi.cc/publication/palanca_candos_2017/), and 📱 [mobile](https://maggi.cc/publication/zheng_greateatlon_2016/) [devices](https://maggi.cc/publication/falsina_grabnrun_2015/).

I currently work as a Research Expert at Huawei Artificial Intelligence for Cyber Security ([AI4Sec](https://ai4sec.net)) Research Team. After more than 15 years, I concluded that I’m still around in the infosec area because it gives me so many opportunities to solve new exciting problems every day.
